   > For the purposes of this document, we’ll consider “sprites” as playable characters, NPCs, and other moving, visible entities in your game.

  - "for anything you draw to the screen, sprites are a good option because
     1. you can explicitly set z index
     2. performance improved since the sprite only redraws when the image has changed in some way
     3. sprite code can be self-contained, i.e. OOP
  - "drawing is done relative to the sprite, not to the screen"

   > Sprites are two-dimensional images or animations overlaid into a scene. They are the non-static elements within a 2D game, moving independently of the background. Often used to represent player-controlled characters, props, enemy units, etc., sprites can be composed of multiple tiles or smaller sprites.
